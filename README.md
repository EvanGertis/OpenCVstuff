# OpenCVstuff
Just a little repo to keep track of my computer vision stuff. This demonstrates three methods combinded together. First I capture video feed. Then I apply the Canny operator. Then I use Hough line transformation to identify straight lines. This order of operations could be used to identify objects for autonomous movement. You can adjust the Canny threshold by using the A or Z key.
